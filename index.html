            <p>Hi, I'm Matt, and welcome to my personal website! This serves as my home on the
internet where I post about various things I find interesting, from updates on
personal projects to recipes. These posts are grouped by year in roughly
chronological order below.</p>
<p>This website was built using my extremely simple static site generator called
<a href="https://github.com/theultimat/webinator">webinator</a>, which exists solely to
save me from the frustration of dealing with broken dependencies whenever I
want to post something.</p>
<p>If you're interested in knowing a little more about me you can head over to the
<a href="/about">about</a> page, and if you're curious as to what I'm currently working on
take a look at <a href="/now">now</a>!</p>
<h1>2025</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="/idli-intro">Idli: A Processor for Tiny Tapeout</a> introduces my instruction set
  architecture, and serves as a starting point for my thoughts and findings on
  its design.</li>
<li>I reworked this website, but preserved the <a href="/old/index">background of the old index page</a>
  because I'm fond of it. Note this page uses JavaScript and WebGL (and is quite
  resource intensive).</li>
</ul>
