            <p>Welcome to the about page! As you may have guessed, my name is Matt Woodhouse,
although I'm also found elsewhere around the internet as theultimat (except when
somebody else got there first). I'm an integrated circuit and firmware engineer
by trade, and as such spend most of my working hours in Vim and tmux using
SystemVerilog, C, C++, various flavours of assembly, and Python.</p>
<p>Some of my interests outside of the hardware/software world include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dinosaurs.</li>
<li>Running and weights.</li>
<li>Playing guitar.</li>
<li>Games of both board and video.</li>
<li>Space.</li>
<li>Lock picking.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find me online in a few other places:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theultimat">YouTube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theultimat">GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The logo for this website was designed by me at around eight years old, although
I did make a couple of tweaks when making use of it for this website (thicker lines,
black instead of lime green). If you come across an account online with this
logo as the avatar then there's a non-zero chance it's me!</p>
